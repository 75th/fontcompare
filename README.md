# Font Compare

Ranks given characters by how different they are in two given fonts.

Give it a string and two fonts installed on your system, and it will show you which characters have the most differences. Click a table row to get a visual preview.

## TODO

- UI for font names and string
- Better layout/appearance
- Normalize by width/height of a given character
- Customizable preview colors
- Trim images instead of always using the entire canvas
	- Option to ignore sidebearings
- Set up as GitHub Pages thingy
- Migrate to some NodeJS build abomination instead of the wonderful CodeKit if this gets sufficient attention to warrant it (unlikely)
